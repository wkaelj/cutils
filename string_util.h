 * Remove the front of a string up to the last instance of a character.
 * Example(stripper='/'): "/home/user/document.txt" -> "document.txt"
 *
 * @param dest may be a valid pointer to a string, or NULL. If dest is null, it
 * will not be written to.
 * @param max may be a valid pointer to a unsigned int. If it's value is 0, it
 * will be written to with the length of the stripped string (including
 * terminator). If it's NULL, it will be ignored and there will be no maximum
 * size for the output. If it's not 0 or NULL, it will be used as the maximum
 * length for the output string.
 * @param src must be a valid pointer to a string. It is the string that will be
 * stripped.
 * @param stripper must be a valid character. It is the character that will be
 * used to strip the src string.
